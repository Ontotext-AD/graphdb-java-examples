# graphdb-java-examples

Examples on how to embed and use graphdb in java. Look in the pom.xml and the test directory for examples on how to start a single node test or a cluster scenario. To run
the tests you will need a proper license.

Note that this is still work in progress because one of the artifacts - tests-base is still not publicly visible(but will be soon)
